<p>
Organisations/ institutions may require additional support and training when implementing and evaluating psychosocial programs.

<p>A healthy workforce is a productive workforce hence I believe wellness should be a priority for all corporate entities. I provide needs analysis to diagnose organisations’ wellness needs and tailor wellness programs to suit the specific challenges and requirements of each client’s needs. My wellness interventions include employee assistance programs and wellness days that provide hands- on support and are targeted at dealing with health issues on an individual, group and or organisational level for transformed workplace health and happiness.
